This folder encompasses all the code for conducting benchmarks on NFTGraph. NFTGraph exhibits a wealth of features at node, edge, and subgraph levels. Therefore, three experiments have been conducted on NFTGraph, targeting different levels of the graph.

## Algorithms:
### node classification (anomaly detection)
We select several commonly used anomaly detection models provided on Python Graph Outlier Detection (PyGOD), a benchmark tool for outlier detection. It is a free tool and available at https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod/.

### link prediction

We select eight state-of-the-art graph neural networks on OGB leaderboards. Thanks to `dgl` package, we benchmark them on NFTGraph easily. The reference codes are listed as follows:

### graph self-supervised learning
We select seven commonly used graph self-supervised learning algorithms and evaluate them on NFTGraph. Thanks for the open-sourced codes, we list them in the following:
