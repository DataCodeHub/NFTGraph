There are two files: `nodes.csv` and `edges.csv` representing the node and edge lists of NFTGraph-All.
The files have been uploaded to Google Drive due to their large size.

There are seven node features: `Address`, `OutAmount`, `OutValue`, `OutTxFee`, `InAmount`, `InValue`, and `InTxFee`. Aside from `Address`, which serves as the unique identifier for each node, the other features represent cumulants from transactions. Specifically, `OutAmount` and `InAmount` represent the cumulative tokens transferred from and to the current node, respectively. Similarly, `OutValue` and `InValue` indicate the cumulative transaction value when the current node is a source and target node separately and `OutTxFee` and `InTxFee` are the cumulative transaction fees paid by the current node as a sender and receiver, respectively.

In addition to these seven node features, it is worth noting that `node_id` corresponds to a unique numerical identifier assigned to each node. Furthermore, the `nodelabel` attribute serves as a binary indicator, where a value of 0 denotes a *User* node, and a value of 1 signifies a *Contract* node. For further elaboration and specific contextual meanings, please refer to the associated research paper.

Each edge has six features: `TxHash`, `Token`, `Amount`, `Value`, `TxFee`, and `Timestamp`. The unique identifier for each edge is `TxHash`, and the `Token` with a certain `Amount` indicates what and how many tokens are transferred, traded, minted, or burned in the transaction. The `Value` feature represents the number of dollars attached to the transaction, while `TxFee` is the fee charged for recording the transaction on the blockchain. Most importantly, each transaction has a `Timestamp` attribute that records the time of the transaction.

Moreover, `txn_id` represents a unique numerical identifier assigned to each edge, whereas `tokenid` is a unique numberical identifier of the transferred `Token`. The `source` and `target` are the head and tail of an edge, respectively, and `from` and `to` are corresponding node addresses of `source` and `target`. There are six values of `edgelabel`ï¼Œ where `10` represents the *Transfer* edge of *User-to-User*, `11` refers to the *Trade* edge of *User-to-User*, `12` is the *Mint* edge of *Null Address-to-User*, `13` means the *Burn* edge of *User-to-Null Address*, `00` represents the *Transfer* edge of *User-to_Contract* and `01` refers to the *Trade* edge of *User-to_Contract*.
