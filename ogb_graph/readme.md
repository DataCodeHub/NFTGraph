This folder encompasses the codes for handling and obtaining NFTGraph data in mainstream graph library formats, namely `ogb`, `pyg`, and `dgl`.

`pyg_dataset` includes codes for obtaining PyG (PyTorch Geometric) graph.

`dgl_dataset` contains codes for obtaining `dgl` graph.

`ogb_dataset` includes codes for obtaining `ogb` graph.

`official_ogb` contains the official code for the 'ogb' library, which is referred to by the code in other directories.

`example_direct_use` are ogb graphs that can be directly used following the instructions on the offical website:
